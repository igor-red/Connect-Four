# Project Name

Connect Four

# Description

Test assignment - replicate [Connect Fun](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/connect-fun-four-in-a-row/id703429662?mt=8) iOS game

## Prerequisites

Xcode 8.3

## Deployment / Installation

Clone git, run Connect Four.xcodeproj

## Architectural choices

Two classes - one for the UIViewController, another - for the Board Data, both separated into two swift files. UI built via AutoLayout.

## Trade-offs

Almost none

## Leftouts

Highlighting the winning combination

## What would do differently

Probably use a two-dimensional array to keep track of the progress. Maybe refactor a bit more. Add winning combination highlighting

## Reasoning for what was achieved

The game was created with one goal in mind - achieve best functionality/value for time spent. As a result we have a fully functional and a bit customizable game (because who wants to play one board size over and over again!) where additional polish would take unreasonable in real life additional time and effort. Overall time spent: 2h for the model, 3h for the UI, 1h for fixes along the way.
